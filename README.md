## JET-SHOP

Jet-Shop is a sample app I wrote to test out Jetpack Compose. 
It's acts as a mobile catalog for a shop which specializes in... well, nothing, really.
I use [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for sample data, so don't expect the selection other retailers are able to provide you with.

Here's to the future of Android Development!
(And, I hope, multi-platform mobile app developing someday :robot: :apple:)
